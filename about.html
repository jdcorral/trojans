            <p>Originally from Pasadena, California, I've made Louisville, Kentucky my home for the past three years. Pasadena is where I studied at the Art Center College of Design and learned many of the skills I use today. I create my designs using the latest technologies, Photoshop and Illustrator but most of the time I start with a sketch using pen and paper. I often use my own illustrations and photos in my graphic designs. I am best known for my most long-lived branding design, the EZ-UP canopy logo, a product that has an international audience. I have experience in all types of media design, billboards, bus ads, stationary, logos, and printed materials as well as photography. Some of my past clients include the City of Los Angeles Workforce Investment Board, the Earned Income Tax Credit Board and Los Angeles International Airport. My latest endeavor has been to author this website that will hopefully afford me another way to showcase my work in this new market.

            ...as an aside, this site would not have been possible had it not been for the encouragement, patience and support of my wonderful wife Trudi. Thanks!
